​📘 Smart Study Companion - User Manual
​Welcome to Smart Study Companion! This guide will help you get started with turning your study materials into powerful, AI-driven learning tools.
​1. Getting Started: Your Access Key
​To begin, you need a valid Access Key. This key unlocks the app's features based on your subscription plan.
​When you first open the app, you will see a prompt asking for your key.
​Enter the key provided to you.
​Click "Unlock" to start using the application.
​Your key is saved in your browser, so you won't need to enter it every time.
​2. Loading Your Study Materials
​The first step is to add your documents to the app.
​How to Upload: You can either drag and drop your files into the upload box on the left, or click the box to select files from your computer.
​Supported Files: You can upload PDFs, text files (.txt), images (.jpg, .png), and even .zip archives containing multiple documents. The app will automatically unpack ZIP files for you.
​File Limits: Your current plan has a limit on the total number of files you can store in your library. This limit is displayed above the upload box.
​3. Managing Your Library
​All your uploaded documents are neatly organized in the "My Library" list.
​Select a Document: Simply click on any document in the list to select it. It will be highlighted, making it the active document for the AI Assistant.
​Delete a Document: To remove a single file, click the trash can icon next to its name.
​Clear Your Library: If you want to start fresh, click the "Delete All" button. Be careful, as this action cannot be undone.
​4. The AI Study Assistant
​This is where the magic happens! Once you have selected a document from your library, the AI Assistant buttons on the right become active.
​Summarize: Get a concise, easy-to-read summary of the document's content. This is perfect for quick revisions.
​Create MCQs: The AI will generate multiple-choice questions based on the text to help you test your understanding and prepare for exams.
​Key Points: Instantly extract the most important facts, definitions, and takeaways from your material into a clean, bulleted list.
​AI Query Limits: Your plan includes a certain number of AI actions (like creating a summary) per day. Your remaining daily count is shown above the action buttons. This counter resets every 24 hours.
​5. Important Information
​Your Privacy is Paramount: We respect your privacy. All file processing (like reading a PDF or scanning an image with OCR) happens entirely on your own device. Your files are never uploaded to our servers. Only the extracted text from a document is sent to the AI when you specifically ask for a summary or quiz.
​Local Data Storage: Your library and access key are saved securely in your browser's local storage. This means if you clear your browser's cache or data, your library will be erased.
